= xmeml format =
The xml export format of FCP, called xmeml, is documented at the Mac OS X Dev Library:

= volume levels = 
Quoting the dev library:
"The volume level for the audio track of a clip is encoded by the Audio Levels effect. 
The parameter Level expresses linear gain rather than decibels. 
To convert gain to decibels, use the formula 
                    decibels = 20 * log10(Level). 
Conversely, to convert decibels to gain, use 
                    Level = 10 ^ (decibels / 20)."
