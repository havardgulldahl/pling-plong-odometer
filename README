Pling Plong Odometer
====================

-- keeping track of what goes into your sound track --

This tool will analyze your FCP project and tell you what 
audio clips goes in it and for how long each clip is audible.

You'll need this data if you're lucky enough to have someone
interested in what music your little masterpiece uses.
